# Business Requirement Management

This repository concentrates features for Business Analysis in general, and Business Requirements in particular.

The Business Requirements features start as independent entities, and can be used as standalone.
Additional modules integrate them with other business areas, such as Sales, Procurement, Project or Analytic Accounting.
So a Quotation can have an estimation supported by a BR analysis, and Project Tasks can be related to the BRs they implement or support.
