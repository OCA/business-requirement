The pricelist stored in the Project/Estimation pricelist field will be used to help the calculation 
of the expected revenue of a Deliverable based on the sum of related RL.

#. In the BR, you can add as many deliverable lines as necessary. You can keep the price empty at that stage.

#. Once the deliverable lines are created you can create as many resources lines as necessary in each DL. 

#. in RL, the estimation sales price will be display per resource.

#. The total Revenue from the resources (sum of the sales estimation for all RL) can be manually added back to the deliverable line.

#. you can review the cost control tab of your BR as followed (only available for ACL Cost Control)

#. Eventually you can manually update the price of all resource clicking on the Update button.
