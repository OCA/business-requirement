=============================================
Business Requirement Deliverable Cost Control
=============================================

Introduction
============

This module is part of a set of modules (`Business Requirements <https://github.com/OCA/business-requirement/blob/8.0/README.md>`_) 

This module improves the cost control of the original module with the following:

* Estimation sales price on resource lines. It provides a simple way to 
  calculate the sales price of the deliverable based on the necessary 
  resources lines (see usage).
* Adds ACL for sales price and resource cost confidentiality.
* Creates a tab Cost control in the Business Requirement for simple Gross Profit
  control.
* Multi-currency compatible: sales price is valued at currency Pricelist and 
  converted back to the reporting company currency for the cost control.

Configuration
=============

Users
-----

* **Business Requirement Sales Estimates**: Can See the sales prices in DL and RL (ideal for sales/presales)
* **Business Requirement Cost Control**: Can See the cost prices for project profit control (Manager/Finance dept)

Estimation Pricelist
--------------------

You can define the Estimation price list in the Master Project which will be 
used in deliverable lines and sales price for the resource lines.


Usage
=====

The pricelist stored in the Project/Estimation pricelist field will be used to help the calculation 
of the expected revenue of a Deliverable based on the sum of related RL.

#. In the BR, you can add as many deliverable lines as necessary. You can keep the price empty at that stage.

#. Once the deliverable lines are created you can create as many resources lines as necessary in each DL. 

#. in RL, the estimation sales price will be display per resource.

#. The total Revenue from the resources (sum of the sales estimation for all RL) can be manually added back to the deliverable line.

#. you can review the cost control tab of your BR as followed (only available for ACL Cost Control)

#. Eventually you can manually update the price of all resource clicking on the Update button.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Display the currency in the cost control panel and deliverable
* As of version 8.0.2.0.0, the estimation pricelist has been moved from Project to 
  Partner object. There is no migration script for the change and the data will have
  to be migrated manually.
