====================================================
Business Requirement Resources Project Task Category
====================================================

Introduction
============

This module is part of a set of modules (`Business Requirements <https://github.com/OCA/business-requirement/blob/8.0/README.md>`_).


This module introduces the use of OCA/project **Task Category Main** in 
the business requirements resource lines.

This way it extends the module business_requirement_project to be able to 
propagate the main category to the task at project/task creation.

Configuration
=============

You can maintain the task categories in the Project/Configuration/Task Category menu.


Usage
=====

#. In the Business requirement, you can add as many Deliverable Lines as necessary. 
   Price of the Deliverable Lines will depend on the pricelist defined in master
   project or customer.

#. Once the Deliverable Lines are created, you can create as many Resource Lines as
    necessary in each Deliverable Lines.

#. in Resource Lines, you can then already assign task category on top of the assignee 
   if necessary.

NB: Task category cannot be assigned to a procurement line.
