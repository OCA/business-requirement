Estimation Pricelist: user can see the Sales price and revenue of the BR.

Master project
--------------

You can define a master project linked to the business requirement. Default Customer
from the project will be used to populate the BR. The customer can be changed if necessary.

Valuation of the Deliverable and Resources lines
------------------------------------------------
When writing a BR the user has the possibility to add Deliverable and Resources lines.
To value the Deliverable lines, you can specify an estimation price list in the customer,
which will be used in 2 main places:

* In Deliverable lines if the deliverable product is in pricelist
* In Resource lines if you want to value your deliverable from the resources

NB: Here is the way Odoo will get a price in Deliverable and Resources Lines:

#. If the Estimation Pricelist field is not empty use the Estimation pricelist
#. If empty, use the standard customer pricelist field
#. If no pricelist available (for example no customer defined in the project), use
   the product Sales price.
