Price list
~~~~~~~~~~

`Estimation Pricelist`: If an estimation pricelist is defined at the partner level, it will be added to the Business Requirement when the partner is added to it.

Prices for the deliverable are calculated based on the pricelist in the BR. User can change the
pricelist in the BR but it will only apply for newer deliverable lines.
