This module is part of a set of modules (`Business Requirements <https://github.com/OCA/business-requirement/blob/10.0/README.md>`_)

Two new concepts complement the main business requirements model:

* Deliverable lines
* Resource lines

A field for pricelist estimation is available in the partner to be used in Deliverable
and Resources lines valuation to customers.

What is a Deliverable Line?
---------------------------

Deliverable Lines (DL) contains products and services that will be delivered to the
customer. They are **customer oriented** and can be either physical or service products:

* Servers and procured goods
* Gap analysis services
* Module development services
* Training etc.

These are the products that will appear in the SO and that the customer/stakeholder will receive.

Configuration
=============

Users
-----

Estimation Pricelist: user can see the Sales price and revenue of the BR.

Master project
--------------

You can define a master project linked to the business requirement. Default Customer
from the project will be used to populate the BR. The customer can be changed if necessary.

Valuation of the Deliverable and Resources lines
------------------------------------------------
When writing a BR the user has the possibility to add Deliverable and Resources lines.
To value the Deliverable lines, you can specify an estimation price list in the customer,
which will be used in 2 main places:

* In Deliverable lines if the deliverable product is in pricelist
* In Resource lines if you want to value your deliverable from the resources

NB: Here is the way Odoo will get a price in Deliverable and Resources Lines:

#. If the Estimation Pricelist field is not empty use the Estimation pricelist
#. If empty, use the standard customer pricelist field
#. If no pricelist available (for example no customer defined in the project), use
   the product Sales price.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. In the BR, you can add as many deliverable lines as necessary. Price of the deliverable
   lines will depend on the pricelist(s) in customer.

#. Once the deliverable lines are created you can create as many resources lines as necessary
   in each DL. Cost price of the product will apply

#. in RL you can already assign the responsible of the task if necessary
