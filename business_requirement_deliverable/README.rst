This module is part of a set of modules (`Business Requirements <https://github.com/OCA/business-requirement/blob/10.0/README.md>`_)

Two new concepts complement the main business requirements model:

* Deliverable lines
* Resource lines

Besides, a pricelist estimation is now available in the partner to be used instead of the standard
pricelist in Deliverable and Resources lines valuation to customers.

Installation
============

If you already have an Odoo instance up and running, your preferred way to install
addons will work with `Business Requirement`.

A reasonable knowledge of Odoo technical management is necessary to be able to
install and run this modules. The
`standard installation how-to <https://www.odoo.com/documentation/12.0/setup/install.html>`_
should be able to get you started.

Using git
~~~~~~~~~
The most common way to install the module is to clone the git repository in your
server and add the directory to your `odoo.conf` file:

#. Clone the git repository

   .. code-block:: sh

      cd your-addons-path
      git clone https://github.com/OCA/business-requirement
      cd business-requirement
      git checkout 12.0 #for the version 12.0

#. Update the addon path of `odoo.conf`
#. Restart Odoo
#. Update the addons list in your database (Menu `Apps > Update Apps List` in developer mode)
#. Install the `Business Requirements` modules in menu `Apps`.

Using pip
~~~~~~~~~
An easy way to install it with all its dependencies is using pip:

#. Recover the code from pip repository

   .. code-block:: sh

      pip install odoo10-addon-business_requirement odoo-autodiscover

#. Restart Odoo
#. Update the addons list in your database (Menu `Apps > Update Apps List` in developer mode)
#. Install the `Business Requirements` modules in menu `Apps`.

Fresh install with Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you do not have any Odoo server installed, you can start your own Odoo in few
minutes via Docker in command line.

Here is the basic how-to (based on https://github.com/Elico-Corp/odoo-docker), valid
for Ubuntu OS but could also easily be replicated in MacOS or Windows:

#. Install docker and docker-compose in your system
#. Create the directory structure (assuming the base directory is `odoo`)

   .. code-block:: sh

      mkdir odoo && cd odoo
      mkdir -p ./volumes/postgres ./volumes/odoo/addons ./volumes/odoo/filestore \
      ./volumes/odoo/sessions

#. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in `odoo` directory with following content:

   .. code-block:: xml

       version: '3.3'
       services:

         postgres:
           image: postgres:9.5
           volumes:
             - ./volumes/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
           environment:
             - POSTGRES_USER=odoo

         odoo:
           image: elicocorp/odoo:12.0
           command: start
           ports:
             - 127.0.0.1:8069:8069
           volumes:
             - ./volumes/odoo/addons:/opt/odoo/additional_addons
             - ./volumes/odoo/filestore:/opt/odoo/data/filestore
             - ./volumes/odoo/sessions:/opt/odoo/data/sessions
           links:
             - postgres:db
           environment:
             - ADDONS_REPO=https://github.com/OCA/business-requirement.git
             - ODOO_DB_USER=odoo

#. Fire up your container (in `odoo` directory)

   .. code-block:: sh

      docker-compose up -d odoo

#. Open a web browser and navigate the URL you have set up in your `docker-compose.yml`
   file (http://127.0.0.1:8069 in this particular example)
#. Create a new database
#. Update the addons list in your database (Menu `Apps > Update Apps List` in developer mode)
#. Install the `Business Requirements` modules in menu `Apps`.

You can improve your new Odoo docker environment (add parameters, change default
passwords etc.) following this `documentation <https://github.com/Elico-Corp/odoo-docker>`_

Now what?
~~~~~~~~~
Check the `Official Documentation <https://www.odoo.com/documentation/12.0>`_ to start using Odoo and developing your own modules.

Configuration
=============

Price list
~~~~~~~~~~

`Estimation Pricelist`: If an estimation pricelist is defined at the partner level, it will be added to the Business Requirement when the partner is added to it.

Prices for the deliverable are calculated based on the pricelist in the BR. User can change the
pricelist in the BR but it will only apply for newer deliverable lines.

Usage
=====

What are Deliverable Lines?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deliverable Lines (DL) contains products and services that will be delivered to the
customer. They are **customer oriented** and can be either physical or service products:

* Servers and procured goods
* Gap analysis services
* Module development services
* Training etc.

These are the products that will appear in the SO and that the customer/stakeholder will receive.

   :alt: Business Requirement Deliverable lines

What are Resources Lines?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Resources Lines (RL) are the different services or physical goods needed to achieve one deliverable:

* Service tasks (Development, consultant etc.)
* Procurement of other physical goods (server, etc.)
* Procurement of other virtual goods (templates, sub-contracting, etc.)

RL depends on the DL or directly on BR (when a task is not linked to a specific deliverable such
as project management)

   :alt: Business Requirement Resources lines

What is the difference between Deliverable and Resources?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

=========== ======================================================== ========================================================
Concept     Deliverable is:                                          Resources are:
=========== ======================================================== ========================================================
Target      Provided to the customer (“Functioning Website”)         Executed internally (“Server+CSS modifications”)
Valuation   Valued at Customer Sales Price                           Valued at Cost Price
Usage       Used in Sales Quotations                                 Used in tasks for Projects or procurement management
=========== ======================================================== ========================================================

Business Requirement contains Deliverable lines and Deliverable line contains Resource lines.

Example of a structure:

::

    BR1
    |
    |- DL1
    |  |
    |  |- RL1
    |  |- RL2
    |  `- RL3
    |
    |- DL2
    |  |
    |  |- RL4
    |  |- RL5
    |  `- RL6
    |
    BR2
    |
    |- DL3
    |  |
    |  |- RL7
    |  `- RL8
    |
    |- DL4
    |  `- RL9

Adding Deliverable lines to the business Requirement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. In the BR, you can add as many deliverable lines as necessary. Price of the deliverable
   lines will depend on the pricelist(s) in customer.
#. Once the deliverable lines are created you can create as many resources lines as necessary
   in each DL.
#. in RL you can already assign the responsible of the task if necessary

   :alt: Inputing the deliverables and resources lines


Valuation of Business Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Value of the BR is the sum of the value of all deliverable lines.

Deliverable in the BR are valued based on the BR pricelist or product sales price:

#. If the Estimation Pricelist field is not empty in partner prefill the BR with
   the Estimation pricelist
#. If empty, prefill the BR with the standard customer pricelist field
#. If no pricelist available (for example no customer defined in the project or BR), use
   the product Sales price.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* As of version 10.0.1.0.0, the estimation pricelist has been moved from Project to
  Partner object. There is no migration script for the change and the data will
  have to be migrated manually.
