This module extends the functionality of Business Requirement to allow you to
create from them Sales Orders, taking deliverables as sales order lines.

**Table of contents**

   :local:

Usage
=====

#. Go to *Business Requirement > Business Requirement*.
#. Open the business requirement you want to quote.
#. Click on "Create Quotation" button.
#. On the wizard popup, mark the sections you want to quote, and the
   deliverables belonging to that section will be marked, or directly mark
   individual ones.
#. There will be a special "Undefined section" checkbox at the end of the
   "Sections" group for marking/unmarking deliverables without section.
#. Click on "Create" for generating the quotation.
#. You will be redirected to the newly created draft sales order (quotation).

You can navigate since this moment to all the created quotations:

#. Go to *Business Requirement > Business Requirement*.
#. Open the business requirement that has been quoted.
#. Look for the smart-button "Sales" on the upper-right part of the form.
#. Click on it for going to the quotation/sales order list.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* The widget many2many_checkboxes has a bug that avoids to refresh contents
  when checkboxes are unmarked programatically, so when you remove some
  sections on the sales order creation wizard, they won't be reflected in
  screen.
* Include an event when checking/unchecking deliverable for updating sections
  accordingly.
