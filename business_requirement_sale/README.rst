you to create from them Sales Orders, taking deliverables as sales order
lines.

**Table of contents**

   :local:

Usage
=====

1. Go to *Business Requirement > Business Requirement*.
2. Open the business requirement you want to quote.
3. Click on "Create Quotation" button.
4. On the wizard popup, mark the sections you want to quote, and the
   deliverables belonging to that section will be marked, or directly
   mark individual ones.
5. There will be a special "Undefined section" checkbox at the end of
   the "Sections" group for marking/unmarking deliverables without
   section.
6. Click on "Create" for generating the quotation.
7. You will be redirected to the newly created draft sales order
   (quotation).

You can navigate since this moment to all the created quotations:

1. Go to *Business Requirement > Business Requirement*.
2. Open the business requirement that has been quoted.
3. Look for the smart-button "Sales" on the upper-right part of the
   form.
4. Click on it for going to the quotation/sales order list.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  The widget many2many_checkboxes has a bug that avoids to refresh
   contents when checkboxes are unmarked programatically, so when you
   remove some sections on the sales order creation wizard, they won't
   be reflected in screen.
-  Include an event when checking/unchecking deliverable for updating
   sections accordingly.
