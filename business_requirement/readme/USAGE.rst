Simple BR
---------
1. Define the header information

   * Master Project (Partner is the one related to the master project)
   * Priority (low, Medium, High)
   * Change request: Is it a change request? (currently only informational with n model or action)
   * Tags: any relevant tag for the business.
   * Owner and approver by default

2. Input the customer story, scenario gap and test case(simple html editor with image and text)

   .. figure:: ../static/img/bus_req_cust_story.png
      :width: 600 px
      :alt: Input customer story, scenario, gap and test case

3. Confirm the Business requirement (for BR User and Manager)
   At that stage the Customer story/Scenario/Gap/Test case is not modifiable anymore

   .. figure:: ../static/img/bus_req_confirmed.png
      :width: 600 px
      :alt: Confirm your business requirement

4. Approve the Business requirement (for BR Manager)

   .. figure:: ../static/img/bus_req_approved.png
      :width: 600 px
      :alt: Confirm your business requirement

5. Once your requirement is finished and delivered you can set it as Done

   .. figure:: ../static/img/bus_req_done.png
      :width: 600 px
      :alt: Confirm your business requirement

6. Alternatively, you can cancel the BR (in case it is not relevant or mistake) or drop it (when customer makes the decision to discontinue it)

   .. figure:: ../static/img/bus_req_cancel.png
      :width: 600 px
      :alt: Cancel your business requirement


   .. figure:: ../static/img/bus_req_drop.png
      :width: 600 px
      :alt: Drop your business requirement

Sub-business requirements
-------------------------
User can create sub business requirements for a given BR for complex cases.

This is a simple parent/child relation (see roadmap).
