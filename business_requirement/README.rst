A **Business requirement** (BR) is the expression of a business need by a customer
or internal project user.

A BR contains multiple different parts to explain the stakeholder need and how to
meet his/her requirements:

* **Customer Story**: this is the requirement as expressed by the customer
* **Scenario**: How/where the current solution can provide a suitable scenario to
  answer the customer story
* **Gap**: For the uncovered part of the scenario, elaborate the gap/need for specific
  developments/setup
* **Test case**: A set of conditions under which a tester will determine whether the application, software system or
  one of its features is working as it was originally established for it to do.
* **Deliverables** to be provided to the customer/user
* **Resources** necessary to achieve the deliverables
* **Additional** information (approval, cost control etc.)

This set of modules was originally designed for the service/IT industry but the
requirement management design has been kept as generic as possible so that it can
apply to many other cases/industries (customer or internal projects):

* Construction
* Trading (New product development)
* Business Consultancy
* Web or IT development
* R&D projects
* etc.

More information about business requirements management:

* `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_requirements>`_
* `Six Sigma <https://www.isixsigma.com/implementation/project-selection-tracking/business-requirements-document-high-level-review/>`_

Business Requirement set of modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module is part of a set (`Business Requirements repo <https://github.com/OCA/business-requirement/tree/12.0>`_).

The base Business Requirements module creates the basic objects and
can be used as a standalone module.

   :width: 600 px
   :alt: Business Requirement List view

Multiple modules integrate the BR with other business areas, such as Sales,
Procurement, Project or Analytic Accounting. For example:

* Sales Quotation can have an estimation supported by a BR analysis
* Project Tasks can be related to the BRs they implement or support
* Procurement and purchase can be generated out of the BR

The following workflow explains the business workflow between the BR modules and other applications in Odoo:

Installation
============

If you already have an Odoo instance up and running, your preferred way to install
addons will work with `Business Requirement`.

A reasonable knowledge of Odoo technical management is necessary to be able to
install and run this modules. The
`standard installation how-to <https://www.odoo.com/documentation/12.0/setup/install.html>`_
should be able to get you started.

Using git
~~~~~~~~~
The most common way to install the module is to clone the git repository in your
server and add the directory to your `odoo.conf` file:

#. Clone the git repository

   .. code-block:: sh

      cd your-addons-path
      git clone https://github.com/OCA/business-requirement
      cd business-requirement
      git checkout 12.0 #for the version 12.0

#. Update the addon path of `odoo.conf`
#. Restart Odoo
#. Update the addons list in your database (Menu `Apps > Update Apps List` in developer mode)
#. Install the `Business Requirements` modules in menu `Apps`.

Using pip
~~~~~~~~~
An easy way to install it with all its dependencies is using pip:

#. Recover the code from pip repository

   .. code-block:: sh

      pip install odoo10-addon-business_requirement odoo-autodiscover

#. Restart Odoo
#. Update the addons list in your database (Menu `Apps > Update Apps List` in developer mode)
#. Install the `Business Requirements` modules in menu `Apps`.

Fresh install with Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you do not have any Odoo server installed, you can start your own Odoo in few
minutes via Docker in command line.

Here is the basic how-to (based on https://github.com/Elico-Corp/odoo-docker), valid
for Ubuntu OS but could also easily be replicated in MacOS or Windows:

#. Install docker and docker-compose in your system
#. Create the directory structure (assuming the base directory is `odoo`)

   .. code-block:: sh

      mkdir odoo && cd odoo
      mkdir -p ./volumes/postgres ./volumes/odoo/addons ./volumes/odoo/filestore \
      ./volumes/odoo/sessions

#. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in `odoo` directory with following content:

   .. code-block:: xml

       version: '3.3'
       services:

         postgres:
           image: postgres:9.5
           volumes:
             - ./volumes/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
           environment:
             - POSTGRES_USER=odoo

         odoo:
           image: elicocorp/odoo:12.0
           command: start
           ports:
             - 127.0.0.1:8069:8069
           volumes:
             - ./volumes/odoo/addons:/opt/odoo/additional_addons
             - ./volumes/odoo/filestore:/opt/odoo/data/filestore
             - ./volumes/odoo/sessions:/opt/odoo/data/sessions
           links:
             - postgres:db
           environment:
             - ADDONS_REPO=https://github.com/OCA/business-requirement.git
             - ODOO_DB_USER=odoo

#. Fire up your container (in `odoo` directory)

   .. code-block:: sh

      docker-compose up -d odoo

#. Open a web browser and navigate the URL you have set up in your `docker-compose.yml`
   file (http://127.0.0.1:8069 in this particular example)
#. Create a new database
#. Update the addons list in your database (Menu `Apps > Update Apps List` in developer mode)
#. Install the `Business Requirements` modules in menu `Apps`.

You can improve your new Odoo docker environment (add parameters, change default
passwords etc.) following this `documentation <https://github.com/Elico-Corp/odoo-docker>`_

Now what?
~~~~~~~~~
Check the `Official Documentation <https://www.odoo.com/documentation/12.0>`_ to start using Odoo and developing your own modules.

   :alt: Email Alias setup

You can start conversation with the followers in the chatter area of the
BR like in tasks, issue or CRM leads.

Sequences
~~~~~~~~~
Default numbering format: BR123456.

You can modify the default numbering sequence in `Settings > Technical > Sequences&Identifier > Sequences`.

Search for Business Requirement sequence and alter it as necessary.

Master project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can define a master project linked to the business requirement.

Followers from the project will automatically be added to the business requirements.

Usage
=====

Simple BR
~~~~~~~~~
1. Define the header information

   * Master Project (Partner is the one related to the master project)
   * Priority (low, Medium, High)
   * Change request: Is it a change request? (currently only informational with n model or action)
   * Tags: any relevant tag for the business.
   * Owner and approver by default

   .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/business-requirement/12.0/business_requirement/static/img/bus_req_tags2.png
      :width: 600 px
      :alt: Input header information

2. Input the Stakeholder story, scenario gap and test case(simple html editor with image and text)

      :width: 600 px
      :alt: Input customer story, scenario, gap and test case

3. Confirm the Business requirement (for BR User and Manager)
   At that stage the Customer story/Scenario/Gap/Test case is not modifiable anymore

      :width: 600 px
      :alt: Confirm your business requirement

6. Alternatively, you can cancel the BR (in case it is not relevant or mistake) or drop it (when customer makes the decision to discontinue it)

   .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/business-requirement/12.0/business_requirement/static/img/bus_req_cancel.png
