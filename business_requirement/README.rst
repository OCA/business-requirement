A **Business requirement** (BR) is the expression of a business need by a customer
or internal project user.

A BR contains multiple different parts to explain the stakeholder need and how to
meet his/her requirements:

* **Customer Story**: this is the requirement as expressed by the customer
* **Scenario**: How/where the current solution can provide a suitable scenario to
  answer the customer story
* **Gap**: For the uncovered part of the scenario, elaborate the gap/need for specific
  developments/setup
* **Test case**: A set of conditions under which a tester will determine whether the application, software system or
  one of its features is working as it was originally established for it to do.
* **Deliverables** to be provided to the customer/user
* **Resources** necessary to achieve the deliverables
* **Additional** information (approval, cost control etc.)

This set of modules was originally designed for the service/IT industry but the
requirement management design has been kept as generic as possible so that it can
apply to many other cases/industries (customer or internal projects):

* Construction
* Trading (New product development)
* Business Consultancy
* Web or IT development
* R&D projects
* etc.
