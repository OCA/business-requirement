Business Requirement
====================

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module is part of a set ("Business Requirement").
The Business Requirements features start as independent entities, and can be 
used as standalone.

Additional modules integrate them with other business areas, such as Sales, 
Procurement, Project or Analytic Accounting. For example:

* Sales Quotation can have an estimation supported by a BR analysis
* Project Tasks can be related to the BRs they implement or support
* Procurement and purchase can be generated out of the BR

What is a Business Requirement?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Business requirement (BR) is the expression of a business need by a customer 
or internal project user. 
A BR can contain multiple different parts depending on the company needs:

* Customer Story: this is the requirement as expressed by the customer
* Scenario: How/where the current solution can provide a suitable scenario to 
  answer the customer story
* Gap: For the uncovered part of the scenario, elaborate the gap/need for specific 
  developments/setup
* Deliverables to be provided to the customer/user
* Resources necessary to achieve the deliverables
* Additional information (approval, cost control etc.)

These modules were originally design for the service/IT industry but the 
requirement management is generic and can apply to many cases/industries (customer 
or internal projects):

* Construction
* Trading (New product development)
* Business Consultancy
* IT development

What is the difference between a BR and CRM lead?

* CRM leads are sales oriented
* BR are project and workload estimation oriented
